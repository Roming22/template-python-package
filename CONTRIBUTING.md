## Project setup

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Launch `Visual Studio Code` and install the `Remote - Containers` extension (ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
- Open a terminal and clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/Roming22/template-python-package.git`.
- Open the project in `Visual Studio code` from the terminal with `code template-python-package`.
- `Visual Studio Code` will prompt you to open the project in a container, click `Reopen in Container`. If you missed the prompt, press `control+shift+p` and type `rebuild` in the command bar and select `Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
- `Visual Studio Code` will build a container, open the project in that container and configure itself for the project. This may take a few minutes.
- Find the `Test` icon on the left sidebar, and click on the `Run All Tests` icon.
- If all the tests are successful, you are ready to start coding.
