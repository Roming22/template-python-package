    Version numbers are in the form `X.Y.Z` where:
      - X is the major version number.
      - Y is the minor version number, odd for development releases,
        even for production releases. Some usecases allow for an alpha character
        after the number.
      - Z is a revision number.

    For work in progress (a.k.a feature) branches:
      - X is 0, to prevent accidental installation from the test pypi instance.
      - Y is the year, month and day the release was generated.
      - Z is the hour, minute and second the release was generated, prefixed by
        dev to prevent accidental installation from the test pypi instance.
